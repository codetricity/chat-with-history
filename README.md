## Key Features Explained

### Automatic Title Generation

The application automatically generates meaningful conversation titles based on the AI's first response. This replaces generic date-based titles with descriptive summaries that help users identify conversations at a glance.

### Conversation Management

- **Create**: New conversations are created automatically when users start chatting
- **Read**: All conversations are displayed in a sidebar with titles and timestamps
- **Update**: Conversation titles are automatically updated after the first AI response
- **Delete**: Users can delete conversations using the trashcan icon

### Conversation Browser

The conversation browser provides advanced organization capabilities:

- **Folder Creation**: Create custom folders with names and descriptions to categorize conversations
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive drag-and-drop to move conversations between folders
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Support for nested folder structures
- **Visual Management**: Clean, modern interface for organizing conversations
- **Persistent Storage**: All folder assignments are saved to the database
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected across all interfaces

Access the conversation browser via the "Organize" button in the chat interface or navigate directly to `/conversation-browser`.

### Web Search Integration

The application features intelligent web search capabilities that automatically enhance AI responses with current information:

- **Smart Detection**: The system automatically detects when a user's question requires current information based on keywords and context
- **Real-time Search**: Uses Tavily API to search the web for up-to-date information
- **Seamless Integration**: Search results are automatically included in the AI's context without user intervention
- **Comprehensive Responses**: AI combines its knowledge with current web information to provide comprehensive answers

**Search Triggers**: The system will automatically search the web when users ask about:

- Current events and news
- Real-time information (weather, stock prices, etc.)
- Latest developments in any field
- Recent updates on any topic
- Questions containing keywords like "current", "latest", "recent", "today", "now", "2024", "2025", "news", "update", "happening", "trending", "what's new", "price", "cost", "rate", "stock", "market", "weather"

**Example Queries that Trigger Web Search**:

- "What are the latest AI developments in 2024?"
- "What's the current weather in New York?"
- "What's happening in the stock market today?"
- "What are the recent updates on climate change?"

**Example Queries that Don't Trigger Web Search**:

- "Explain what Python is"
- "How do I cook pasta?"
- "What is the capital of France?"

### Modern UI/UX

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Real-time updates using HTMX
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Clean, accessible interface following modern design principles
