## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)

For a complete setup with sample data, see the [Quick Setup Guide](README_SETUP.md):

```bash
# Complete setup with fake data in one command
uv run python oppsetup.py
```

This will create the database, add sample data, and set up everything you need to explore the application.

### Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ (tested with Python 3.12.11)
- uv package manager
- **SECRET_KEY** (required for authentication and security)
- OpenRouter API key (for AI chat functionality)
- Tavily API key (for web search functionality)
- OpenAI API key (for hybrid search embeddings)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd store-retrieve-conversations
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

1. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables (or copy from the example below):

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test.db

# Application Security (REQUIRED)
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key_here_at_least_32_characters

# Environment (development or production)
ENVIRONMENT=development

# API Keys for AI Features
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The SECRET_KEY is required for the application to work properly.**

**Environment Variable Details:**

- **DATABASE_URL**: Database connection string. Defaults to SQLite for development. For production, use PostgreSQL: `postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/dbname`
- **SECRET_KEY**: **REQUIRED** - Application secret key for session management and JWT tokens. Must be at least 32 characters long. Generate a secure key for production.
- **ENVIRONMENT**: Set to `development` for local development or `production` for deployment. Controls debug mode and other environment-specific settings.
- **OPENROUTER_API_KEY**: Required for AI chat functionality. Get your key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- **TAVILY_API_KEY**: Required for web search integration. Get your key from [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Required for hybrid search embeddings. Get your key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)

**Generate a secure SECRET_KEY:**

```bash
# Generate a secure 32-character secret key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

**Quick Setup Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Install dependencies: `uv sync`
2. ‚úÖ Create `.env` file with SECRET_KEY (required!)
3. ‚úÖ Add API keys for AI features
4. ‚úÖ Run migrations: `uv run python oppman.py migrate upgrade`
5. ‚úÖ Start the app: `uv run python main.py`

**Validate your environment setup:**

```bash
# Check if all environment variables are properly configured
uv run python scripts/check_env.py
```

This script will verify that all required environment variables are set and provide security recommendations.

1. Run database migrations:

```bash
# Option 1: Using oppman (recommended)
uv run python oppman.py migrate upgrade

# Option 2: Using Alembic directly
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

1. Set up hybrid search (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Chunk existing conversations for search (one-time setup)
uv run python -c "
from services.chunking_service import ChunkingService
from services.embedding_service import EmbeddingService
import asyncio

async def setup_search():
    chunking_service = ChunkingService()
    embedding_service = EmbeddingService()
    
    # Chunk all existing conversations (new messages are automatically chunked)
    total_chunks = await chunking_service.chunk_all_conversations()
    print(f'Created {total_chunks} conversation chunks')
    
    # Generate embeddings for all chunks
    from services.hybrid_search_service import HybridSearchService
    hybrid_service = HybridSearchService(embedding_service)
    await hybrid_service.build_faiss_index()
    print('FAISS index built successfully')

asyncio.run(setup_search())
"
```

**Note**: New messages are automatically chunked when added to conversations, so this step only needs to be run once for existing conversations.

1. Start the application:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **Missing SECRET_KEY**: The application requires a SECRET_KEY to function. Generate one using the command above.
- **Missing API Keys**: Ensure all three API keys (OpenRouter, Tavily, OpenAI) are set in your `.env` file
- **Database Connection Issues**: Check that `DATABASE_URL` is correctly formatted
- **Secret Key Issues**: Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is at least 32 characters long and doesn't contain spaces
- **Environment Validation**: Run `uv run python scripts/check_env.py` to diagnose configuration issues

**For Production Deployment:**

*For sharing with friends or future employers, SQLite is fine. If you are running a business with the database, use PostgreSQL.*

### Fly.io Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Fly.io. The following secrets are already configured:

```bash
# Check current secrets
fly secrets list

# Expected secrets:
# SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, ENVIRONMENT, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Deploy to Fly.io:**

```bash
# Deploy the application
fly deploy

# Check deployment status
fly status

# View logs
fly logs
```

**Setting Secrets on Fly.io:**

```bash
# Set individual secrets
fly secrets set SECRET_KEY="your_secure_secret_key_here"
fly secrets set DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/test.db"
fly secrets set ENVIRONMENT="production"
fly secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key"
fly secrets set TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_key"
fly secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"

# Or set multiple secrets at once
fly secrets set SECRET_KEY="your_key" DATABASE_URL="your_db_url" ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

### General Production Guidelines

- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in your environment
- Use a PostgreSQL database for high-traffic applications: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/dbname`

- **Simplified Commands**: Easy-to-remember commands similar to Django's `manage.py`
- **Automatic Configuration**: Handles Alembic setup and configuration automatically
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and troubleshooting
- **Integrated Workflow**: Seamlessly integrates with the project's database initialization
- **Backup Management**: Automatic database backups before destructive operations

#### **Database Initialization**

```bash
# Complete setup with all fake data
uv run python oppsetup.py

# Minimal setup (database + superuser + users only)
uv run python oppsetup.py minimal

# Reset database and run complete setup
uv run python oppsetup.py reset
```

#### **Database Migrations**

```bash
# Initialize migrations (first time only)
uv run python oppman.py migrate init

# Create a new migration
uv run python oppman.py migrate create "Description of changes"

# Apply all pending migrations
uv run python oppman.py migrate upgrade

# Check current migration status
uv run python oppman.py migrate current

# View migration history
uv run python oppman.py migrate history

# Downgrade to previous migration
uv run python oppman.py migrate downgrade <revision>
```

#### **Database Management**

```bash
# Backup current database
uv run python oppman.py backup

# Delete database (with backup)
uv run python oppman.py delete

# Check environment configuration
uv run python oppman.py env
```

#### **Server Management**

```bash
# Start development server
uv run python oppman.py runserver

# Stop development server
uv run python oppman.py stopserver
