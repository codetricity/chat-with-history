## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) installed globally
- Basic understanding of Markdown
- Familiarity with the FastOpp project

### Installation

```bash
# Install Marp CLI globally
npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli

# Or use npx (no installation required)
npx @marp-team/marp-cli --help
```

### Viewing Slides

#### Option 1: HTML Output
```bash
# Generate HTML from Markdown
marp docs/slides/01_course_overview.md -o docs/slides/01_course_overview.html

# Open in browser
open docs/slides/01_course_overview.html
```

#### Option 2: PDF Output
```bash
# Generate PDF
marp docs/slides/01_course_overview.md -o docs/slides/01_course_overview.pdf
```

#### Option 3: Live Preview
```bash
# Start live preview server
marp docs/slides/01_course_overview.md --preview

# Or watch for changes
marp docs/slides/01_course_overview.md --watch
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
# Convert all slides to HTML
for file in docs/slides/*.md; do
  marp "$file" -o "${file%.md}.html"
done

# Convert all slides to PDF
for file in docs/slides/*.md; do
  marp "$file" -o "${file%.md}.pdf"
done
```

## üé® Customization

### Themes

The slides use the `gaia` theme by default. You can change this by modifying the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
theme: gaia  # or 'default', 'uncover'
_class: lead
paginate: true
backgroundColor: #fff
---
```

### Styling

You can customize the appearance by:

1. **Modifying the frontmatter** in each slide file
2. **Adding custom CSS** using the `style` directive
3. **Using Marp directives** for advanced formatting

### Example Customization

```yaml
---
theme: gaia
_class: lead
paginate: true
backgroundColor: #f0f0f0
backgroundImage: url('path/to/background.jpg')
style: |
  section {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  }
  h1 {
    color: #2c3e50;
  }
---
```

## üìñ Course Structure

### Learning Flow

1. **Start with Course Overview** - Understand the big picture
2. **AI Chat UI** - Learn about streaming and context management
3. **Conversation Organization** - Master business-focused organization
4. **Vector Databases & Hybrid Search** - Implement intelligent search

### Assessment Flow

1. **Test features** on live site with learning objectives
2. **Review code** and documentation
3. **Watch video tutorials** (coming soon)
4. **Subscribe** for video notifications as we complete them

## üîß Development

### Adding New Slides

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `docs/slides/` directory
2. Use the Marp frontmatter format
3. Follow the existing slide structure and naming convention
4. Update this README with the new slide information

### Slide Structure

Each slide file should follow this structure:

```yaml
---
theme: gaia
_class: lead
paginate: true
backgroundColor: #fff
---

# Slide Title

## Subtitle

Content here...

---

# Next Slide

More content...
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep slides focused** - One concept per slide
- **Use clear headings** - Make the structure obvious
- **Include code examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Add visual breaks** - Use `---` to separate sections
- **Test regularly** - Preview slides as you create them

## üåê Integration with FastOpp

These slides are designed to work alongside the FastOpp project:

- **Live site** - Test features as you learn
- **Code examples** - All examples are from the actual codebase
- **Real-world context** - Business use cases and practical applications
- **Hands-on learning** - Build while you learn
