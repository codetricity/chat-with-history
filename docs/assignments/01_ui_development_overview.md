# **UI Development Assignments**
## Building Alternative Interfaces for FastOpp

**Create Modern UIs with React, Flutter, Vue, and More**

---

# Assignment Overview

## What You'll Build

- **Alternative conversation browsers** using different UI frameworks
- **Custom organization systems** tailored to specific use cases
- **Mobile-first interfaces** for on-the-go access
- **Collaborative workspaces** for team environments
- **Specialized dashboards** for different business needs

---

# The Challenge

## Beyond the Default UI

The current FastOpp system provides a solid foundation with:
- **FastAPI backend** with comprehensive APIs
- **Business context integration** (clients, projects, folders)

# API Endpoints Overview

## Core Endpoints You'll Use

```http
GET /api/conversations          # List all conversations
GET /api/folders               # List conversation folders
GET /api/clients               # List clients
GET /api/projects              # List projects
GET /api/search                # Hybrid search conversations
POST /api/conversations        # Create new conversation
PUT /api/conversations/{id}    # Update conversation
DELETE /api/conversations/{id} # Delete conversation
```

---

# Authentication

## How to Authenticate

```javascript
// Include JWT token in requests
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

// Login endpoint
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

# Data Models

## Key Data Structures

```typescript
interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  folder_id?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  is_active: boolean;
}

interface Folder {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  project_id?: string;
  parent_folder_id?: string;
  description?: string;
}

interface Client {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  company: string;
  email: string;
  industry: string;
}
```
